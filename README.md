# Med Conversation Assistant — Internet Demo (FastAPI)

## Note：This project is fully generated by ChatGPT-Pro. The prompt is "I want to build a demo for industry partners, the demo is a medical conversation assistant which can helps you to make some diagnosis and provide suggestions, the demo should be accessible from the Internet, show me the solution".

**Purpose:** a lightweight, internet-deployable demo of a *medical conversation assistant* for industry partners.

**Important:** This is **demo software** for evaluation only. It does **not** provide medical diagnosis and is **not** suitable for clinical use.

---

## Features
- Web chat UI + structured JSON output panel (triage + differential possibilities + next steps).
- Rule-based emergency/urgent screen (very lightweight).
- Basic PII redaction (demo only).
- Optional password protection (`DEMO_PASSWORD` env var).
- Works locally, via Docker, or on common PaaS providers.

## Quick start (local)

### 1) Create a virtualenv + install
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2) Set env vars
**Option A: real LLM**
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY"
export MODEL_NAME="gpt-4o-mini"   # change if needed
```

**Option B: mock mode (no API key)**
```bash
export LLM_PROVIDER="mock"
```

Optional demo password:
```bash
export DEMO_PASSWORD="your-demo-password"
```

### 3) Run
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Open: http://127.0.0.1:8000

## Docker
```bash
docker build -t medassist-demo .
docker run -p 8000:8000 \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY" \
  -e MODEL_NAME="gpt-4o-mini" \
  -e DEMO_PASSWORD="partner123" \
  medassist-demo
```

## Deploy to the internet (example: Render)

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. In Render: **New → Web Service → from GitHub**.
3. Runtime: Docker (or Python).
4. Set environment variables:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - `MODEL_NAME` (optional)
   - `DEMO_PASSWORD` (recommended)
5. Deploy → you get a public HTTPS URL.

> For a partner demo, password-protect it and avoid collecting identifiable patient information.

## Suggested “industry partner demo” talking points
- **Structured output** (JSON) reduces risk vs free-form chat.
- **Safety screens**: emergency escalation + no medication dosing.
- **Next step for production**: add clinician-reviewed retrieval sources + monitoring + evaluation + compliance review.

## Next steps if you want this to look “enterprise-grade”
- Add login (OAuth) + role-based access.
- Add rate-limiting + abuse prevention.
- Add retrieval from vetted guidelines (NICE/CDC/WHO) with citations.
- Add evaluation harness: red-flag recall, hallucination rate, refusal correctness, and human review workflow.
- Add privacy controls: data minimization, encryption at rest, retention policy, consent banner.
